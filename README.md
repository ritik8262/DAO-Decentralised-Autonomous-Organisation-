#### <ins>DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation)</ins>: 
It is a transparent organisation controlled by group of organisation's members and is not led by central govt. Smart Comtracts lays the foundational rules, execute the agreed upon decisions and at any points proposals of vating by the members.


#### <ins> ThirdWeb </ins>:
- It is the platform which help us to deploy contracts without actually writing them. It has pre-built contracts for common cases like NFT's, tokens, etc. It also gives us the feature to build our own smart contract using thirdweb extensions and then deploy it. 
- It provides us with a set of tools which help to interact with our contracts just like SDK's.
- SDK's enables us to build Web3 applications which are also known as DAPP's by various capabilities:
  * Helps us to connect with our Wallets.
  * Deploying and interacting with smart contracts
  * Uploading and resolving metadata from IPFS
